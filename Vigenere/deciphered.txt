NEITHER MUST WE FORGET THAT THE REPUBLIC IS BUT THE THIRD PART OF A STILL LARGER DESIGN WHICH WAS TO HAVE INCLUDED AN IDEAL HISTORY OF ATHENS AS WELL AS A POLITICAL AND PHYSICAL PHILOSOPHY THE FRAGMENT OF THE CRITIASHAS GIVEN BIRTH TO A WORLD FAMOUS FICTIONS E CONDONLY INIMPORTANCE TO THE TALE OF TROY AND THE LEGEND OF ARTHUR AND ISSAID AS A FACT TO HAVE INSPIRED SOME OF THE EARLY NAVIGATORS OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURYTH IS MYTHICAL TALE OF WHICH THE SUBJECT WAS  A HISTORY OF THE WARS OF THE ATHENIANS AGAINST THE ISLAND OF ATLANTIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE FOUND EDUPONANUN FINISHED POEM OF SOLON TO WHICH IT WOULD HAVE STOOD IN THE SAME RELATION AS THE WRITINGS OF THE LOGOGRAPHERS TO THE POEMS OF HOMERIT WOULD HAVE TOLD OF A STRUGGLE FOR LIBERTY CPTIMINTENDED  TO REPRESENT THE CONFLICT OF PERSIA AND HELLAS WE MAY JUDGE FROM THE NOBLE COMMENCEMENT OF THE TIMAEUS FROM THE FRAGMENT OF THE CRITIASIT SELF AND FROM THE THIRD BOOK OF THE LAWS IN WHAT MANNER PLATO WOULD HAVE TREATED THIS HIGH ARGUMENT WE CAN ONLY GUESS WHY THE GREAT DESIGN WAS ABANDONED PERHAPS BECAUSE PLATO BECAME SENSIBLE OF SOME INCONGRUITY IN AFICTITIOUS HISTORY OR BECAUSE HE HAD LOST HIS INTEREST IN IT OR BECAUSE ADVANCING YEARS FORBADE THE COMPLETION OF IT AND WE MAY PLEASE OURSELVES WITH THE FANCY THAT HAD THIS IMAGINARY NARRATIVE EVER BEEN FINISHED WESHOULD HAVE FOUND PLATO HIMSELF SYMPATHISING WITH THE STRUGGLE FOR HELLENIC INDEPENDENCE CPLAWSSINGINGAHYMN OF TRIUMPH OVER MARATHON AND SALAMIS PERHAPS MAKING THE REFLECTION OF HERODOTUS WHERE HE CONTEMPLATES THE GROWTH OF THE ATHENIAN EMPIRE HOW BRAVE A THING IS FREEDOM OF SPEECH WHICH HAS MADE THE ATHENIANS SO FAR EXCEED EVERY OTHER STATE OF HELLAS INGREATNESS OR MORE PROBABLY ATTRIBUTING THE VICTORY TO THE ANCIENT GOOD OR DEROF ATHENS AND TO THE FAVOR OF APOLLO AND ATHEN ECPINTRODTO CRITIAS AGAIN PLATO MAY BE REGARDED AS THE CAPTAIN ARHCHEGOZOR LEADER OF A GOOD LYBAND OF FOLLOWERS FOR IN THE REPUBLIC IS TO BE FOUND THE ORIGINAL OF CICEROS DE REPUBLICA OF STAUGUSTINES CITY OF GOD OF THE UTOPIA OF SIRTHOM AS MORE AND OF THE NUMEROUS OTHER IMAGINARY STATES WHICH ARE FRAMED UPON THE SAME MODEL THE EXTENT TO WHICH ARISTOTLE OR THE ARISTOTELIAN SCHOOL WERE IN DEBTED TO HIM IN THE POLITICS HAS BEEN LITTLE RECOGNISED AND THERE COGNITION IS THE MORE NECESSARY BECAUSE IT IS NOT MADE BY ARISTOTLE HIMSELF THE TWO PHILOSOPHERS HAD MORE INCOMMON THAN THEY WERE CONSCIOUS OF AND PROBABLY SOME ELEMENT SOFPLATO REMAIN STILL UNDETECTED IN ARISTOTLE IN ENGLISH PHILOSOPHY TOO MANY AFFINITIES MAYBE TRACED NOT ONLY IN THE WORKS OF THE CAMBRIDGE PLATONISTS BUT IN GREAT ORIGINAL WRITERS LIKE BERKELEY OR COLERIDGE TO PLATO AND HIS IDEAS THAT THERE IS A TRUTH HIGHER THAN EXPERIENCE OF WHICH THEM IND BEARS WITNESS TO HERSELF IS A CONVICTION WHICH IN OUR OWN GENERATION HAS BEEN ENTHUSIASTICALLY ASSERTEDANDIS PERHAPS GAIN IN GGROUND OF THE GREEK AUTHORS WHO ATTHE RENAISSANCE BROUGHT A NEW LIFE INTO THE WORLD PLATO
